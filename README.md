# SmartHomeNotifier
Develop tool to automatically alert the user to use home appliances
For e.g. It's better to use washing machine on a sunny day not just to dry things quickly outside but because then to make use of peak solar energy capacity and reduce the carbon footprint of the grid. This tool combines live data sources for example on weather forecasting with open APIâ€™s on energy production the algorithm works out when best to plan on doing your laundry and inform your users in good time.

libraries used:
-- pandas

configparser
smtplib

The future work consists of exploring more optimisation algorithm for finding ideal time, forecasting methodology can be applied individually for the fuel types and the low carbon to high carbon ratios are predicted depending on individual fuel type forecast for more accurate information and providing more features to the user as inputs and output can be given by other modes of communication.
